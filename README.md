## üöÄ Installation

To use **Kritisi**, make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed. Then, install the tool globally using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g kritisi
```

## üìò Usage Instructions

Once **Kritisi** is installed globally, you can use it from the command line by typing `kritisi` followed by the desired command. Here are the available commands:

1. **View Help**
   To see a list of available commands, use:

   ```bash
   kritisi help
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   Usage: kritisi [options] [command]

   A powerful AI-driven security audit tool for Solidity smart contracts.
   Detect vulnerabilities, enhance code quality, and ensure compliance with best practices.

   Options:
     -V, --version           output the version number
     -h, --help              display help for command

   Commands:
     setkey                 Set an API key for the selected service
     setmodel               Set the AI model for the selected service
     natspec                Process NatSpec documentation for Solidity files
     security               Run a security audit for Solidity smart contracts
     help                   Display help information for available commands

   Run 'kritisi <command> --help' for detailed usage of a specific command.
   ```

2. **Set API Key**
   Before using the AI services, you need to set up your API key. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   kritisi setkey --service <service>
   ```

   `<service>`: Specify the service to be used, such as `openai` or `groq`. Example:

   ```bash
   kritisi setkey --service openai
   ```

   You will be prompted to enter your API key.

3. **Set AI Model**
   Set the AI model for the selected service, use the following command:

   ```bash
   kritisi setmodel --service <service>
   ```

   `<service>`: Specify the service to be used, such as `openai` or `groq`. Example:

   ```bash
   kritisi setmodel --service openai
   ```

   You will be prompted to input the model name interactively.

4. **Add NatSpec Documentation**
   To automatically add NatSpec documentation to your Solidity code, use the following command:

   ```bash
   kritisi natspec --service <service> --path <path>
   ```

   `<service>`: Specify the AI service (e.g., `openai` or `groq`).  
   `<path>`: Specify the path to your Solidity file. Example:

   ```bash
   kritisi natspec --service openai --path ./contracts/MyContract.sol
   ```

4. **Security Audit**
   To run a security audit on your Solidity contracts, use:

   ```bash
   kritisi security --service <service> --path <path>
   ```

   `<service>`: Specify the AI service (e.g., `openai` or `groq`).  
   `<path>`: Specify the path to your Solidity file. Example:

   ```bash
   kritisi security --service groq --path ./contracts/MyContract.sol
   ```

The audit results will be saved as a PDF file in the same location as your Solidity file.

## üìÇ Example Output

### Security Audit

The results are presented as a JSON report converted into a PDF file like this:

```json
{
  "high": [
    {
      "issue": "Reentrancy vulnerability in withdraw function.",
      "suggestion": "Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.",
      "code_highlight": "function withdraw() public { ... }"
    }
  ],
  "medium": [],
  "low": []
}
```
